Fotogram Challenge
===================

## Instructions

1. Produce some stories, break them down into tasks, and estimate
2. Fork this repo, clone, etc
3. Initialize a new rails project

## Task

Your challenge is to build Instagram using Rails. You'll need **users** who can post **pictures**, write **comments** on pictures and **like** a picture. Style it like Instagram's website (or more awesome).

Bonus if you can add filters!

## User Stories:

```
As a user
So that I can see a list of pictures
I want to be able to access Fotogram and see the pictures

As a Fotogram user
So that I can add a nice picture
I want to be able to post a picture

As a Fotogram user
So that I can give my opinion
I want to be able to Like a picture

As a Fotogram User
So that I can give a opinion
I want to be able to write a comment on a picture

As A user
So that I can use Fotogram
I want to be able to Sign up

```


## Code Quality

For linting, you can use the `.rubocop.yml` in this repository (or your own!).
You'll need these gems:

```ruby
gem "rubocop", "0.48.1"
gem "rubocop-rails"
```

You can also lint Javascript, CSS, and ERB — feel free to research this. These
will help you to train yourself to produce cleaner code — and will often alert
you to mistakes or mishaps!
