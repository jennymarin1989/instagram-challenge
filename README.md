Fotogram Challenge
===================


The goal in this challenge is to build an Instagram clone using Ruby on Rails, so the user can post pictures with title and brief description, can edit the post, save the post and rate them.

## User Stories:

```
As A user
So that I can use Fotogram
I want to be able to Sign up

As a Fotogram user
So that I can add a nice picture
I want to be able to post a picture

As a Fotogram user
So that I can add a picture description
I want to be able to post a picture with a brief comment


As a user
So that I can see a list of pictures
I want to be able to access Fotogram and see the pictures

As a user
So that I can remove a picture
I want to be able to delete a picture from my list

More features

As a Fotogram user
So that I can give my opinion
I want to be able to Like a picture

As a Fotogram User
So that I can give a opinion
I want to be able to write a comment on a picture

```

## Thoughts

This assigment was very challenging for me but I learnt a lot from it. I couldn't finish the implementation of like a picture and write a comment but the user can sign in, create a post, edit a post and view the list of pictures. If given more time, I could have finished all the user stories.
