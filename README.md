Fotogram Challenge
===================

The goal in this challenge is to build an Instagram clone using Ruby on Rails, so the user can post pictures with title and brief description, can edit the post, save the post and rate them.

## Thoughts

This assigment was very challenging for me but I learnt a lot from it. I couldn't finish the implementation of like a picture and write a comment but the user can sign in, create a post, edit a post and view the list of pictures. If given more time, I could have finished all the user stories.
